Sure! Below is a well-written README file for the Bank App:

# Bank App

The Bank App is a simple React application that allows users to manage transactions. Users can view a table of all transactions, add new transactions using a form, and filter transactions based on the search term. The app does not persist data to a backend server, so all transactions are stored in the application state and will be lost on page refresh.

## Getting Started

To run the Bank App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd bank-app`.
3. Install the required dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Features

- View a table of all transactions.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. The new transaction will be added to the table.
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term will be shown in the transactions table.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- JSX: A syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to define UI components.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the components.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
bank-app/
  ├── src/

  └── README.md
```

- `src/`: Contains all the React components and the main `App.js` file.
- `public/`: Contains the `index.html` file, the entry point for the app.
- `db.json`: A JSON file used for the backend server when simulating data persistence (not used in the core deliverables).
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: Configuration files for npm packages and dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file, providing information about the Bank App.
